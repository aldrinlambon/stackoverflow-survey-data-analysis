## Project Motivation

For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey data from 2017-2019 to better understand the characteristics of freelance developers, specifically:
1. Which countries do freelance developers mostly reside?
2. What types of developers do freelancing?
3. How does skill sets and job satisfaction relate to salary as a freelancer?
