## Project Motivation
---
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey data from 2017-2019 to better understand the characteristics of freelance developers, specifically:
1. What types of developers are doing freelance work?
2. How does the salary differ between freelances and full-time developers?
3. What factors about a freelance developer contributes most to salary?
