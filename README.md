## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Stack Overflow survey data from 2017-2019 to better understand the characteristics of freelance developers, specifically:
1. Which countries do freelance developers mostly reside?
2. What types of developers do freelancing?
3. How does skill sets and job satisfaction relate to salary as a freelancer?

## Notebook Description
- DataCleaning.ipynb - General data extraction, tranformation and loading of the survey datasets from 2017-2019
- CountryStats.ipynb - Analysis of counties using the number of residing freelance developers
- DevTypeStats.ipynb - Analysis of developer type and technologies used to understand freelance developers' chracteristics
- SalaryModeling.ipynb - Modeling of salary using developer type and technologies used

## Results

The main findings of the analysis can be found at this blog post
